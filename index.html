I've been a part of the club since freshman year. In 2019-2020, I led a team to create Murder That Mansion. I work on mostly programming and video game design, but I also dabble in artwork when no one else is available.Outside of the club I play golf for Huron and participate in other clubs like BPA."></member-profile>

        <member-profile name="Adithya Laakso" projects="Murder That Mansion, Medieval Capital" img_link="/assets/adithya.jpg" description="I have been a member of The VGDDC since my freshman year. For the team I primarily write code and participate in game mechanics discussions. I like to think of myself as the realist on the team. Paying attention to what we can actually accomplish and keeping our ambition within the parameters of reality. I also consider myself to be the purist of the team, attempting to dissuade laziness and sloppiness.Computers are my main hobby. Outside of the club and school, I also program for the Huron Robotics team, contribute to open     source software and make coding side projects by myself and with friends. I am particularly passionate about using computers to interpret language and UNIX-based operating systems. While learning about and programming for computers does take up most of my time, I also play tennis and am on student council. I enjoy reading and writing both fiction and non-fiction (I have a soft-spot for fantasy and speculative fiction). I find television, especially situational comedy and those over-dramatic sci-fi shows     from decades past to be amusing from time to time. I enjoy reading about science because it makes me feel like I am tearing the face off nature and staring at the face of God. I have been called the team's token narcissist. If I call you a bozo, it is not personal."></member-profile>

          <h1>More Information</h1>
          <h6>We meet Mondays and Wednesdays after school in room 4202.</h6>
          <h6>Currently, we have two projects in development: <i>Medieval Capital</i> and <i>Project Odyssey</i>. Medieval Capital is a city-building game focused around hiring employees to manage your city. Project Odyssey is an RPG with a unique battle system and fantasy story.</h6>
          <h6>We use the game engine <i>Unity</i> for development, but we've also used the (arguably better) engine <i>Godot</i> before.</h6>
